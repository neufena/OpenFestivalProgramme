# Open Festival Programme

### A Framework for creating mobile web (and native with Phonegap) mobile programmes. 

This was originally create as an online programme for [Superbyte Festival 2012] (http://superbytefestival.co.uk/) and expanded to work as an offline web app and within Phonegap.
A demo with some basic data and images can be found at [mfp.minusmoney.co.uk] (http://superbytefestival.co.uk/)

Features:

* Multiple Stages
* Multiple Days
* Profile for each act/artist with image, description, website link and youtube video
* Ability to disable publish of times on a per stage basis
* Programme data can be updated centrally without needing to reinstall app
* A-Z of acts/artists
* Link different performances on stages to one act/artist profile

The code is working and ready to go but technical knowledge is needed to set things up, it's not ready out of the box.
I am available as a freelancer to set up the programme, manage it for you and publish mobile apps. Please contact me to discuss
If you use this code please let me know as I'm interested to see it in use. If the event's in the UK a couple of tickets would be a nice thank you....!

Current development is focused on bug fixes, code tidying and automated tested, feel free to jump in and help.

Planned for version 2:

* Stand alone pages (ie, about, contact etc)
* Last.fm link/integration on profiles
* Manual refresh data button
* Regular data update (not just on open)
* Images for stage headers
* Images for Day and Home headers
* Parameterise term for 'Artist' and 'Stage' to allow tailoring for event (ie 'speaker, 'presenter', 'theatre' etc)
* Support for images other than JPEG

Ideas, praise, criticism and general chatter all welcome
